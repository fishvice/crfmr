## Typical science project

```{r out.width = "75%", fig.cap = "From: Grolemund and Wickham"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://heima.hafro.is/~einarhj/crfmr_img/data_science.png")
```

-   Import
    -   Import data stored in a file, database, or web API, and load it into R
-   Tidy
    -   Each column is a variable, and each row is an observation

<!-- -->

    “Tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.”
                                                                - Hadley Wickham

-   Transform
    -   Narrowing in on observations of interest
    -   Creating new variables that are functions of existing variables
    -   Calculating a set of summary statistics (like counts or means)
    -   ...
-   Visualize
    -   May show unexpected things
    -   May raise new questions about the data
    -   A powerful communication platform
    -   ...
-   Model
    -   Once questions made sufficiently precise, one can use a model to answer them
    -   Model cannot question its own assumptions!
-   Communicate
    -   Presentation and documentation

### Our aim

Our aim in this short course is to:

-   Get you up and running with importing, visualization and transformation of data.
-   Introduce you to reproducible analysis and document writing.
-   Introduce you to programming (functions and loops) and modelling.
-   Get you a head start with analyzing your own data.

We are going to use a set of tools that fall under the **tidyverse** umbrella. These are basic set of **generic** tools that are integrated to work seamlessly with one another.

We believe that the tools introduced will get your quickly up and running with your own data, solving \>50% of the most common tasks. Going through the [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz) by Grolemund and Hadley (which serves as our basic template for some of course structure) will pick up additional 30+%.

## Getting started

### R

#### What is R?

-   R is command line driven programming language
    -   its biggest appeal is one can **reuse** commands
    -   its biggest hurdle in widespread use
-   R is open-source:
    -   Other statistical software packages can be extremely expensive
    -   Large user base with almost all statistical methods implemented

#### Why R?

R has become the *lingua franca* of statistical analysis and data wrangling in fisheries science.

-   Its free! If you are a teacher, a student or a user, the benefits are obvious
-   It runs on a variety of platforms including Windows, Unix and MacOS
-   It provides an unparalleled platform for programming new statistical methods in an easy and straightforward manner
-   It offers powerful tools for data exploration and presentation
-   It has ample resources on the web

#### Download R

See [Installing R and RStudio](installing.qmd#download-and-install-r).

### RStudio

### What is RStudio?

-   [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio) is an integrated development environment (IDE)
-   It is open-source and free.
-   Built to help you write R code, run R code, and analyze data with R
-   Text editor, project handling, markdown support, keyboard shortcuts, debugging tools, version control, ...
-   Within RStudio one can achieve almost all that is needed to complete a typical science project, be it:
    -   A technical report
    -   A scientific manuscript
    -   Web pages (including blogs)
    -   ...

#### Download RStudio

See [Installing R and RStudio](installing.qmd#rstudio).

### Running RStudio

A typical RStudio window may look something like this:

```{r out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://heima.hafro.is/~einarhj/crfmr_img/rstudio.png")
```

-   **Script editor**: This is where you write the code for your analysis. These could include:
    -   **R script** - An R script is basically a series of stored R commands that can be run in the console - To generate a new script do: New file -\> R Script (ctrl-shift-N)
    -   **Rmarkdown document**: A document with (or without) R-code.
-   **Console**: This is where R prints the output of your code when it's run. You can also write code directly in the console after the `>` symbol, but that code is not preserved.
-   **Environment/History**: Have at minimum the following tabs:
    -   **Environment**: Displays all your obtjects (data) and user-defined functions in your current session. One can click on the objects to get a detailed view.
    -   **History**: Contains a list of previous commands entered into the console
    -   Additional tabs may include:
        -   **Connection**: Any database connections
        -   **Build**: If your project is webpage/blog project
        -   **Git**: If your project has version control
        -   **Tutorial**: Some nice basic tutorials on R
-   **Files/Packages/Help/Viewer**:
    -   **Files** - The list of all files contained in your current *working directory*. You can also:
        -   Navigate to different folders on your computer.
        -   Create new blank files or folders (directories)
        -   Delete files or folders
        -   Rename files or folders
        -   ... More
    -   **Plots** - Graphical output from R. The user can export the figures to file (as jpeg, png or pdf) or to clipboard
    -   **Packages** - The list of packages (groups of functions) currently installed on your computer. You can install new packages or update existing packages from this tab by clicking `Install` or `Update`.
    -   **Help** - Search R documentation to get information what each function does and how. **Using the help should be your first stop when trying to figure out how to use a particular function.** The lingo may be intitially unfamiliar but with frequent use it becomes more bearable.
    -   **Viewer**: For interactive graphics

#### RStudio project

-   RStudio allows us to make things a little bit easier by isolating various tasks within specific projects (**read**: directory/folder on your computer).
-   Projects save the state between sessions. This includes:
    -   Working directories
    -   Open files/scripts
    -   Workspaces (.RData file - do not save this)
-   One can have multiple RStudio projects open at any one time
    -   The modern call for multitasking :-)

We strongly urge you to get into the habit of splitting your various tasks into specific RStudio projects.

::: callout-tip
## RStudio project and our first code

1.  Open R-studio and create a new project: File -\> New project ... -\> New directory --\> Empty project --\> ...
2.  Create a new R script: File -\> New file -\> R Script
3.  Copy the content of [this code](http://www.hafro.is/~einarhj/tcrenv/R/exercise1.R) into the R script.
4.  Save the script, e.g. exercise1.R: File -\> Save
5.  We will run each line of code, observe, change, add, and most importantly learn while doing
6.  Once you have gone through the whole script, try: File -\> Compile Report ..., choosing the output according to your liking :-)
:::

#### RStudio: Global options

When you install RStudio it comes with a set of default options. You can change the defaults by doing: Tools -\> Global Options...

We strongly urge you to changes at minimum two of the options:

-   General - Workspace:
    -   **No tickmark** before "Restore .RData into workspace at startup"
    -   Select "Never" after "Save workspace to .RData on exit"
-   R Markdown
    -   **No tickmark** before "Show output inline for all R Markdown documents

## Packages

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### What are packages?

-   Packages are a collection of functions and data with documentations.
-   Numerous basic packages come with R but the strength of the R-environment comes from the huge amount of packages that are provided by third sources.

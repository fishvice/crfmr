## 2023-07-21 task - create a github account

### Register

Register an account with GitHub. It’s free!

[https://github.com](https://github.com)

### Username

github is a professional social coding medium. Hence, (contradictory) recomendation from the [happygit](https://happygitwithr.com):

* Incorporate your actual name! People like to know who they’re dealing with. Also makes your username easier for people to guess or remember.
* Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss
* Shorter is better than longer
* Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible
* We highly recommend all lowercase

### Send me your github name

Once done, send me (einar.hjorleifsson at gmail.com) your github name

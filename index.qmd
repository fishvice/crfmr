## Syllabus/schedule (VERY PRELIMINARY)

* Points of considerations when it comes to course structure:
  * Should intersperse fisheries science theoreticals and R-coding
  * Should aim mixing lectures presentation (current draft definitively loop-sided)
  * Should provide time within R-lectures for participants to run premade code
    * This means that everything will take longer time than anticipated

# Basic concepts

## Population and sample {.smaller}

**Population** - the set of all subjects that inference should be made about (e.g., skipjack tuna population in Saint Lucian waters)

**Sample** - the set of subjects that are sampled from a given population (e.g., landed catch samples from landing sites)

## Variables {.smaller}

**Variable** - certain property measured on the subjects in the sample (e.g., length, weight, age)

**Categorical variable** - indicate category and do not have numerical values (e.g., mature/immature)

**Numerical variables** - have numerical values measured in some unites (e.g., length in mm)

**Continuous variables** - when a numerical variable can have any numerical value on some intervals (e.g., length). One measures continuous data

**Discrete variables** - are not continuous. All categorical variables and discrete and some numerical variables e.g., numbers of fish. One counts discrete data

**Exploratory and Response Variables -** values of explanatory variables (*x)* influence the values of response variables (*y*). Several explanatory variables can influence a response variable. e.g., does temperature (*x*) affect the weight of the fish (*y*).

## Descriptive and Inferential Statistics

**Descriptive statistics** involves analyzing the samples to show descriptions, and summaries of the data in a meaningful way. Conclusions are not drawn beyond the sample. e.g., histograms, scatterplots, boxplots, spatial maps.

**Inferential statistics** are techniques that allow us to use the sample to generalize to the population or make inferences about the population. Sample should be an accurate representation of the population.

# Descriptive statistics

## Distribution shapes

```{r }
include_graphics("images/distribution_shapes.png")
```

## Outliers

Outliers are measurements that differ greatly from other measurements in the sample. Important to look at them specifically and consider their cause.

```{r }
include_graphics("images/outliers.png")
```

## Statistics that describe central tendency {.smaller}

-   **Mode** - most frequent outcome (most common value)

-   **Median** - mid-point when all data are arranged from smallest to largest

-   **Mean** - adding all measurements and dividing by the total number of measurements

-   **Weighted mean** - if different weights need to be given to each measurement, multiply each measurement by weight and divide by sum of weight

-   Look at data distribution to decide which statistic to use

-   If the distribution is skewed, bimodal or multimodal the median shall be used rather then the mean.

-   The median should also be preferred if there are outliers in the measurements

## Statistics that describe spread {.smaller}

The spread of measurements describes how spread out the measurements are.

-   **Range** - obtained by $x_{max} - x_{min}$

-   **Quartile** - There are three quartiles

    ```{r }
    include_graphics("images/quartiles.png")
    ```

-   **Interquartile range** - $Q_3 - Q_1$

-   **Five number summary**

    $$min, Q_1, Q_2, Q_3, max$$

-   **Percentiles** - same as quartile but instead of every 25th, any proportion can be used

-   **Variance** $s^2$ - a measure of dispersion around the mean

-   **Standard deviation** $s$ - square root of variance

    -   should be used when the mean is used to describe the central tendency because they are sensitive to skewness and outliers

    -   A five number summary is more informative for skewed distributions

## Data Visualization {.smaller}

First step is to look at data visually to understand the nature of the data

**Discrete variable** - Pie charts / Bar Graphs (usually better)

**Continuous variables**

-   Histograms - visual distribution

-   Boxplots - visualize spread

Scatterplots - visualize relationships between variables

**We will explore these in the R environment**

# Inferential statistics

## Population and Sample

**Inferential statistics:** To generalize from a sample to a larger group

-   If the sampling scheme is appropriate then the generalization works.

## The ideology behind hypothesis tests {.smaller}

1.  A hypothesis is found $H_1$ which describes what we want to demonstrate and another that describes a null $H_0$ case.

2.  It is defined what values of the test statistic are "improbable" according to the probability distribution in the null case (use some $\alpha$-level).

3.  If the retrieved estimate classifies as "improbable" the hypothesis for the null stage is rejected and the hypothesis we want to demonstrate is claimed (use $p$-value to decide).

4.  If the estimate is not "improbable" no claims are made.

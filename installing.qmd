## Preamble

For this course you need install R, Rtools and RStudio and a sweep of packages onto your computer.

## Download and install R

Latest version of **R**: see [The Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org). Follow the instructions to complete the installation process:

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/install01.png")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/install02.png")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/install03.png")
```

### Rtools

If your platform is **Windows**, it is recommended that you install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools)

## RStudio

### What is RStudio?

-   Rstudio, developed by a company called [posit](https://posit.co), is an integrated development environment (IDE) with a set of tools built to help you be more productive with R and other softwares:
-   Includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution.
-   Features tools for plotting, viewing history, debugging and managing your workspace.

Within RStudio one can achieve almost all that is needed to complete a typical science project be it:

-   Statistical analysis
-   Reports, scientific manuscripts, books
-   Webpages (including blogs)

### Download and install RStudio Desktop

Latest version of **RStudio Desktop** can be obtained from this [link](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/#Desktop)

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/install04.png")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/install05.png")
```

## Installing packages

We may as well try to install/update the main package we will use the course now. Lets try to run the following (We would be surprised if this works for everybody in the first go):

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

This will install among other things the **core** tidyverse packages:

-   [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org), for data visualization.
-   [dplyr](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org), for data manipulation.
-   [tidyr](http://tidyr.tidyverse.org), for data tidying.
-   [readr](http://readr.tidyverse.org), for data import.
-   [purrr](http://purrr.tidyverse.org), for functional programming.
-   [tibble](http://tibble.tidyverse.org), for "tibbles", a modern re-imagining of data frames.
-   [stringr](http://stringr.tidyverse.org), for strings
-   [forcats](http://forcats.tidyverse.org), for factors
-   [lubridate](http://lubridate.tidyverse.org), for date/times.

`library(tidyverse)` will load these packages.

Additional packages will be install as we progress through the course.
